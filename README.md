# chessEngine
working on a miniMax engine (incomplete)

Currently in the last stages of creating the two player chess game. Working on debugging the checks/checkmates/stalemates but otherwise game functions work as expected. The next stage is creating the minimax engine and making it more effecient by pruning the game tree. Some inspiration of the engine is taken from the stockfish code (wrtiten in c++) but everything in this project is and will be my own.
